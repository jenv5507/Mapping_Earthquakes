# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to map the earthquake data.  In addition, I added the tectonic plate boundaries so that you could see where the earthquake data is in relation to the tectonic plates.  Also, we added the major earthquakes so that you could see earthquakes that had a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

I added the dark style to the map which really helps pop out the earth quake and the tectonic data.  It is my favorite view of the map!
